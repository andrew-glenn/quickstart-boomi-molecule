*Contents*

This Quick Start was created by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[_Quick Starts_] are automated reference deployments that use AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy key technologies on AWS, following AWS best practices.

[[overview]]
= Overview

[[_heading=h.30j0zll]]This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a Dell Boomi Molecule cluster on the AWS Cloud.

[[_heading=h.1fob9te]]This Quick Start is for users who are looking for an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that can be hosted on AWS. This Quick Start enables you to deploy a Dell Boomi Molecule cluster on AWS and administer it through the https://platform.boomi.com/[_Dell Boomi AtomSphere platform_].

[[dell-boomi-on-aws]]
== Dell Boomi on AWS

Dell Boomi service is a minimal-code, cloud-based iPaaS that enables customers to design, deploy, manage, and govern all of their data across their hybrid and software as a service (SaaS) applications by connecting and integrating external application data with AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Redshift using Dell Boomi’s point-and-click graphical interface.

The Dell Boomi Molecule is a single-tenant, clustered runtime that runs separately from the platform, enabling multiple processes to run concurrently. The enterprise-grade version of a Boomi Atom runtime, the Boomi Molecule can be deployed across multiple servers to enhance load balancing and ensure high availability for mission-critical integration processes.

[[cost-and-licenses]]
== Cost and licenses

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance type, will affect the cost of deployment. For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using. Prices are subject to change.

*Tip* After you deploy the Quick Start, we recommend that you enable the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-gettingstarted-turnonreports.html[_AWS Cost and Usage Report_] to track costs associated with the Quick Start. This report delivers billing metrics to an S3 bucket in your account. It provides cost estimates based on usage throughout each month, and finalizes the data at the end of the month. For more information about the report, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports-costusage.html[_AWS documentation_].

This Quick Start requires an account with Dell Boomi. The Dell Boomi account used to stage this Quick Start will determine the licensing model that applies.[[_Toc2671245]] To get started, sign up for the https://boomi.com/form/trial/[_Free Trial_]. You will then receive a call from a Boomi Sales Engineer, who will enable access to Boomi Molecule.

[[architecture]]
= Architecture

Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with *default parameters* builds the following Dell Boomi environment in the AWS Cloud.

image:./tmp/media/media/image2.png[image,width=648,height=430]

*Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for Dell Boomi on AWS*

The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* A Application Load Balancer.
* In the public subnets:

* Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets, with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.

* In the private subnets:

* Four Amazon EC2 instances with the Dell Boomi Molecule software installed, two in each Availability Zone.
* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) deployed in the Region. Two Amazon EFS mount points are created also, one in each Availability Zone.

*** The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.

[[planning-the-deployment]]
= Planning the deployment

[[specialized-knowledge]]
== Specialized knowledge

[[_heading=h.4d34og8]]This Quick Start assumes familiarity with basic concepts of networking, bastion hosts, volume sizing, and compute performance. It also assumes familiarity with the Dell Boomi variables that are required when deploying a Molecule cluster. These variables include Molecule Name, Local Path, Local Temp Path, Account Id, Account Name, and Account Password. If you don’t have have an Account Name or Password, you can enter an installation token provided by your system administrator into the ‘Boomi MFA install token’ field. If you are an administrator, see the ‘Create an Installation Token’ section in this guide. You will also need an API Token with this installation method. See the steps later in the document on how to create both of these. This Quick Start follows the patterns for Unattended Dell Boomi Molecule deployments found in the http://help.boomi.com/atomsphere/GUID-27BDD6B1-E6BD-48C9-8C6D-EC1B2CA60316.html[_Dell Boomi User Guide_].

This deployment guide also requires a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If you’re new to AWS, visit the https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[_Getting Started Resource Center_] and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[_AWS Training and Certification website_] for materials and programs that can help you develop the skills to design, deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS Cloud.

[[aws-account]]
== AWS account

If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com/[_https://aws.amazon.com_] by following the on-screen instructions. Part of the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.

Your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services. You are charged only for the services you use.

[[technical-requirements]]
== Technical requirements

Before you launch the Quick Start, your account must be configured as specified in the following table. Otherwise, deployment might fail.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[*Resources*] a|
*If necessary, request* *service limit increases for the following resources. You might need to do this if you already have an existing deployment that uses these resources, and you think you might exceed the default limits with this deployment. For default limits, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/[AWS documentation].*

*link:_blank[AWS Trusted Advisor] offers a service limits check that displays your usage and limits for some aspects of some services. *

|======================================================

|https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[*Regions*] |This deployment includes Amazon EFS, which is not available in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported Regions, see AWS Regions and Endpoints in the AWS documentation.
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[*Key pair*] a|
Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the Region where you are planning to deploy the Quick Start. Make note of the key pair name. You’ll be prompted for this information during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[instructions in the AWS documentation].

If you’re deploying the Quick Start for testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend that you create a new key pair instead of specifying a key pair that’s already being used by a production instance.

|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html[*IAM permissions*] |To deploy the Quick Start, you must log in to the AWS Management Console with IAM permissions for the resources and actions the templates will deploy. The _AdministratorAccess_ managed policy within IAM provides sufficient permissions, although your organization may choose to use a custom policy with more restrictions.
|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket.html[*S3 buckets*] |Unique Amazon S3 bucket names are automatically generated based on the account number and Region. If you delete a stack, the logging buckets are not deleted (to support security review). If you plan to re-deploy this Quick Start in the same Region, you must first manually delete the S3 buckets that were created during the previous deployment; otherwise, the re-deployment will fail.
|Amazon EFS |Amazon EFS is an AWS managed file storage system for Linux systems. With Amazon EFS, there is no requirement to provision, patch, or manage a file storage system. Linux systems mount EFS through mount targets using standard NFSv4 mounting options.
|SSL Certificate |You can supply your own SSL certificate, or provision one with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) prior to launching this Quick Start.
|*Boomi MFA install token* |An MFA installation token generated by your Dell Boomi Administrator
|*Boomi MFA API token* |An MFA API token generated by your Dell Boomi Administrator
|===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

[[deployment-options]]
== Deployment options

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy Dell Boomi Molecule into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components, and then deploys Dell Boomi Molecule into this new VPC.
* *Deploy Dell Boomi Molecule into an existing VPC*. This option provisions Dell Boomi in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure CIDR blocks, instance types, and Dell Boomi settings, as discussed later in this guide.

[[authentication-options]]
== Authentication options

This Quick Start provides two authentication options:

* *Deploy Dell Boomi Molecule with username/password.* This option allows the user to put in a username/password who is authorized to create new Atoms.
* *Deploy Dell Boomi Molecule with installation token and API key*. This option provisions doesn’t share any passwords and is recommended. Instead of providing username/password, you will provide the following: username, API Key, and installation token.

[[deployment-steps]]
= Deployment steps

[[step-1.-sign-in-to-your-aws-account]]
== Step 1. Sign in to your AWS account

1.  Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com/[_https://aws.amazon.com_] with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_heading=h.3dy6vkm[_Planning the deployment_] earlier in this guide.
2.  Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_heading=h.17dp8vu[_Technical requirements_] section.
3.  Use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy Dell Boomi Molecule on AWS.
4.  Select the key pair that you created earlier. In the navigation pane of the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[_Amazon EC2 console_], choose *Key Pairs*, and then choose your key pair from the list.
5.  Select the SSL certificate, as discussed in the link:#_heading=h.17dp8vu[_Technical requirements_] section. In the navigation pane of the http://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/[_Amazon ACM console_], select the domain the certificate is associated with, and then copy the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate.

[[step-2.-launch-the-quick-start]]
== Step 2. Launch the Quick Start

*Notes* The instructions in this section reflect the older version of the AWS CloudFormation console. If you’re using the redesigned console, some of the user interface elements might be different. +
 +
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for using this Quick Start. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS service you will be using in this Quick Start. Prices are subject to change.

1.  Choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template into your AWS account. For help choosing an option, see link:#_heading=h.4d34og8[_deployment options_] earlier in this guide.

|===================================================================
| |
|https://fwd.aws/XExbV[_Deploy Dell Boomi into a +
new VPC on AWS_] |https://fwd.aws/aDgWD[_Deploy Dell Boomi into an +
existing VPC on AWS_]
|===================================================================

*Important* If you’re deploying Dell Boomi Molecule into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances, and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[_shared subnets_]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[_NAT gateways_] in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. You will also need the domain name option configured in the DHCP options as explained in the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[_Amazon VPC documentation_]. You will be prompted for your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about 20 minutes to complete.

1.  Check the Region that’s displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This is where the network infrastructure for Dell Boomi Molecule will be built. The template is launched in the US East (Ohio) Region by default.
2.  On the *Select Template* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
3.  On the *Specify Details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary.
+
In the following tables, parameters are listed by category and described separately for the two deployment options:

* link:#option-1-parameters-for-deploying-dell-boomi-molecule-into-a-new-vpc[_Parameters for deploying Dell Boomi Molecule into a new VPC_]
* link:#option-2-parameters-for-deploying-dell-boomi-molecule-into-an-existing-vpc[_Parameters for deploying Dell Boomi Molecule into an existing VPC_]
+
When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.

1.  On the *Options* page, you can https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html[_specify tags_] (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html[_set advanced options_]. When you’re done, choose *Next*.
2.  On the *Review* page, review and confirm the template settings. Under *Capabilities*, select the two check boxes to acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources and that it might require the capability to auto-expand macros.
3.  Choose *Create* to deploy the stack.
4.  Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is *CREATE_COMPLETE*, the Dell Boomi Molecule is ready.
5.  Use the URLs displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack to view the resources that were created.

[[step-3.-test-the-deployment]]
== Step 3. Test the Deployment

To view the Molecule in the Dell Boomi AtomSphere platform, log in to your Dell Boomi https://platform.boomi.com/[_account_], navigate to the *Manage* drop-down menu, and choose *Atom Management*. The newly created Amazon EC2 instance Molecule cluster will be displayed.

image:./tmp/media/media/image3.png[image,width=648,height=293]

*Figure 2: Dell Boomi Dashboard with an unattached AWS-managed Molecule cluster*

You can then attach the Molecules to any environment you have staged and deploy workloads to that Molecule cluster. By Default the molecule you deployed will be under ‘Unattached Atoms’. When you click on ‘Atom Information’ you will see an option to attach it to an environment.

[[security]]
= Security

This Quick Start deploys a bastion host and a Dell Boomi Molecule cluster into an AWS VPC. The bastion host is the only means of accessing the Dell Boomi Molecule cluster at a command-line level. The Dell Boomi Molecule cluster is deployed into private subnets and cannot be reached through the internet. The Boomi Molecule cluster communicates through a NAT Gateway for updates and patches, and it communicates through the public-facing Classic Load Balancer to communicate with the Dell Boomi AtomSphere platform.

[[performance-monitoring]]
= Performance monitoring

Monitoring the CPU, network, and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) performance of your AWS Dell Boomi Molecule cluster is done through CloudWatch metrics.

CPU and network performance are measured in utilization, network in and out, network packets in and out, and system status checks.

Amazon EBS volume performance is measured in read and write throughput, average read and write size, read and write bandwidth, read and write latency, and volume idle time.

Amazon EFS reports metrics to CloudWatch and can be monitored there. Metrics include client connections, data read and data write bytes, and IO percent limits.

[[troubleshooting]]
= Troubleshooting

*Q.* I encountered a CREATE_FAILED error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state will be retained and the instance will be left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue

*Important* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you will continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[_Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation_] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a non-S3 location, you might encounter template size limitations when you create the stack. For more information about AWS CloudFormation limits, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[_AWS documentation_].
